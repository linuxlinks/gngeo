GNGEO : A NeoGeo emulator for linux (and maybe some other unix)

REQUIREMENT : 
	SDL-1.2.x and the libz
	Opengl headers
	optional: nasm 0.98 for i386 asm optimisation
	You will also need a neogeo BIOS

INSTALLATION :
	./configure && make
	then 'make install' as root 

	The configure script will detect the presence of nasm, and
	choose the different CPU core in consequence. You can force
	the use of one cpu core with the following configure switch:
	 --enable-star
	 --enable-gen68k
	 --enable-raze
	 --enable-mamez80      

	To disable completly i386 assembler
	 --disable-i386

After this, you can start a game with the folowing command:
# gngeo /path/to/neogeo/game.zip

CONFIGURATION :
All configuration can be done in $HOME/.gngeo/gngeorc
a sample file is provide : sample_gngeorc
Every option are also accessible on the command line.

By default, gngeo search bios and games in
$prefix/share/gngeo/ (the game must be in a zip file, the bios not)

As mame, a games is defined by a driver. All the driver are
in an unique file (by default $prefix/share/gngeo/romrc, it'll be
installed after a make install)

FRONTEND :
GGF:      The first frontend available for gngeo. It's written in Java, support
          game preview, very detailled game description and support many gngeo options.
